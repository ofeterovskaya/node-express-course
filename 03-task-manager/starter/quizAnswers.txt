What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed with most persistent storage systems.

You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
We can use the dotenv package to load the variables from the .env file into process.env.

How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
We can add .env to your .gitignore file to prevent Git from tracking it. This way, the .env file will
 not be included when we push our code to the GitHub repository. Here's how a .gitignore file might looks:
 node_modules/
.env
This .gitignore file tells Git to ignore the node_modules directory and the .env file.
